	<h1>Dodgeball Team</h1>
	<p>The five individuals below are the ones chosen for my dream dodgeball team. I could've picked real life people in order to make things fair,
        but I decided I wanted to win, so I chose a team of fictional characters I thought would be near impossible to beat. I am very confidant with the 
        characters I have chosen and as such, have come up with a team name for them. The team name I have given them is the "The Champions." It's basic, I know, but it gets the point across.
    </p>
	<div class="grid">
        
    <div class="box a"><img src="images/Player_1.png" height="300" width="200">
       The flash, aka the fastest man alive. He was an obvious choice for the team since he has incredible speed for dodging. He would also be able 
    to catch the balls fairly easy, and likely even throw fast enough. </div>

    <div class="box b"><img src="images/Player_2.png" height="200" width="100">Neo from the Matrix has proven himself to be quite the worthy opponent. His most iconic scene of dodging the bullets made him
        another obvious canidate for the team.</div>
    

    <div class="box c"><img src="images/Player_3.png" height="100" width="100">
    The Hulk's power is incredible. He would be able to catch any dodgeballs thrown at him, and throw them back with 10xs the force.
Hopefully he doesn't hurt anyone though.</div>
    
    <div class="box d"><img src="images/Player_4.png" height="200" width="100"> Spider-man can do whatever a spider can. Which includes his spider senses. 
    That combined with his acrobatic nature, he's sure to be a vital member of the team.</div>
   
    <div class="box e"><img src="images/Player_5.webp" height="100" width="100"> The final member of the team is Elastigirl. She can 
    stretch her body into any shape and size, making dodgeing balls no problem. She's also versitle with her powers and uses them creativly.</div>
