    <li>Denise Jacobs argues that we all have a troll-like inner critic. Of the methods she identifies to banish this troll, which would be most successful for you? Why?</lil>
        <p>The troll banishing method that would work best for me is the reassign duty method. The reason is because I tend to get overly critical of my designs before they are complete, causing me to not want to finish. If I wait until my design is complete, the troll within me would be more managable.</p>
    <li>In David McRaney's article, what is "hyperbolic discounting"? List one method McRaney identifies to counteract hyperbolic discounting. Which would work best for you?</li>
    <p>In the article McRaney defined hyperbolic discounting as becoming more rational when forced to wait. The method I think would work best for me is to think in the now rather than relying on my future self. As the article states, the future self will be in a different setting and have a different thought process, therefore, unreliable. </p>
    <li>Critical Web Design addresses four types of power in networks. As you learn web publishing fundamentals, what network-making power do you (or don't you) have as the creator and publisher of your work?</li>
    <p>The network powers that the creator or publisher would have control over is Networking power, being what is included within the network and Network power, the understanding of the protocols and standards</p>
