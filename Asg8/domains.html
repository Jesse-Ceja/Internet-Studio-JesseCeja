	<h2>Discussion Summary</h2>
	<p>I spoke with a friend outside of class in regards to the domain names. He is quite knowledgeable in both business and technology, so he 
        understands the best way to approach situations like this. I felt he would be a good person to get his input about the semester project and naming.  
         When I told him about the premise of my website and what it I would offer it's users, he actually helped me brainstorm names that could be easy to
        remeber while not likely to be taken domains. Another reason I sought his opinion is because he also enjoys sharing stories and writing. The conversation was
       not only productive, but honestly kind of fun.</p>
	
	<h3>Chosen Domain Name</h3>
	<p>I decided to go with the domain name, CJH.com. The reason I went with this name is because the simplicity of it compared to the other two. 
        I also chose it because of the meaning behind the letters. It is an homage to a pen name I created in highschool back when I wanted to write a novel.
        The pen name was "CJ Hardgraves." "CJ" being my initials backwards and "Hardgraves" being a knockoff version of the name "Hargreeves." A bit of an inside joke.
        In the case the domain name becomes unavaiable after this is submitted my backup will be, Storyteller.gallery.
