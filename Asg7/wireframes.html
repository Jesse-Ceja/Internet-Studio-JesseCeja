    <li>What are the advantages and disadvantages of sketching wireframes over wireframe software?</li>
    <p>The advantages of sketching wireframes are that it is faster, allows more felxibility for the design process, 
        and has a limited amount of distractions. The cons to sketching the wireframes are that you would need to duplicate your work 
        as they have no version control for future editing. Also they are low-fedility and non-interactive, have limited collaberation 
        with no standardization, and overall just look ugly. 
    </p>
    <li>Write a paragraph on which type of wireframing style would work best with your project and why.</li>
    <p>The style of wireframe that would work best for my project would likely be wireframing software. The reason for this is because
        it would be more conveniant to keep track of over a physical copy. Plus, using wireframing software allows for revesions and edits 
        if I were to remove or come up with new features. I also just tend to have a personal prefrence for computer based assignments to remain 
        on my computer.
