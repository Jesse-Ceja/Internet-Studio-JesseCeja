	<h1>Dream Jobs</h1>
	<p>I've always been someone who has enjoyed any kind of media with an engaging story. Whether it be books, movies, animated or live action films, video games, I love them all.
		With that said, any job within a creative field would be amazing. Since I have always had interests in storytelling and art, jobs related to those would be preferred.
		Though as of recently, I've been open to the idea of getting a job or working positions within churches, in order to serve God. It would be especially cool, if I found
		a position within a church that would allow me to use my art interest for them and the Lord. 
	</p>

<li>Graphic Designer - Neeley External Relations</li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4321998546" target="_blank">linkedin</a></li>
	  </ul>  
	  I feel that this particular position would be a pretty good fit for me because it fits some personal prefrences. For one, it's a graphic design position
	  which is what my degree study is. Another reason I feel this job could be good for me is because of where it is based in. TCU is a christian university so 
	  it alligns with my relegious ideals.

		<li><a href="https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=ec86ad613a789e21&from=shareddesktop_copy" target="_blank">indeed</a></li>
	  </ul>
	  This particular position could be a good fit because of the company being a church, where I could use my passions for God. Video editing
	  is also a passion I have taken up recently. Being able to do this for a church would be pretty cool. Plus it's close to home.

		Minimun requirments needed. Related to my interests. Pays a good amount. Seems diverse enough for work.
