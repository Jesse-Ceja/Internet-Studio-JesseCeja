	<h1>Summary</h1>
	<article>
	<p class="intro">After having a discussion with somoeone outside of the course about the semester project, I came to realize the idea I submitted is too vauge
		and not well thought out. Due to this realization, I deceided to change the premise of my semester project. Instead of my original idea 
		of creating a homework hud, it was suggested that I use a passion of mine and use that as a basis for my semester project. So, the new idea
		for my semester project will be a forum of sorts for people who like to write or create stories and showcase them to others for feedback. Almost
		like a social media app for people who want to share their story drafts or ideas and connect with other writers or creators.</p>
	
	<h2>White Hat</h2>
	<p>The information we have for this idea is to create a platform for writers and storytellers to share their work and create some community.
		Information needed in order to expand upon this newer idea is how to get people interested in this. What is missing for this project is 
	    the overall formatting as it is a recent change and has not had as much time to be developed. Questions that should be asked regarding this
	    newer version of the project are, "What can we expect?" and "How will this work?" We can get this information by thinking about how we
	    would want to advertise this new site or page to others who might be interested. </p>
	<h2>Red Hat</h2>
	<p>What I am feeling about this latest change in topic of the semester project is that while I do have to go back to the planning boards,
		I know that I will enjoy it more this time because it is about a passion I have had for a long time. It was addressed that since this
		is a topic I am passionate about, it will make it easier to plan out how you want to execute it. My hunches about the new direction of this
		project is that I could either end up with a new site that many can enjoy, or it will end up not being used at all. My feelings about this
		chnage range from excitement to a lingering bit of fear of failure.</p>
	<h2>Black Hat</h2>
	<p>From the newly proposed ideas thrown out, I would say that everything fits together in some way, but this idea still has some faults. 
		For example while it was proposed that when uploading written work to share with others, it could have a feature that allows viewers to add 
		edits or suggestions to their submission. While this can be a good feature to receive feedback and criticism, it can easily be used to delete 
		progress depending on how much editing access is given. Other potential downsides are that people don't use the site or forum at all because 
		it could be viewed as too similar to other sites.</p>
	<h2>Yellow Hat</h2>
	<p>This project might work because in personal experience, many writers struggle with finding people to share their work with without some 
		persoonal biases. The value this would have on the writing community could be great, if executed correctly. What can be done to make this work
		is adding features that similar sites or forums don't have or utilize well. With adding features or combining aspects from other ideas can 
		attract more users and receive positive attention.</p>
	<h2>Green Hat</h2>
	<p>Other ways to look at this project are either, viewing it as a social media type of platform, or to view it from the eyes of a consumer rather 
		than as the creator. Alternatives that I haven't considered when planning this is how not everyone is comfortable with sharing their work.
		Plus those who are comfortable sharing their work to the public, usually do so anonymously or do so by publishing them for profit. Ideas 
		I had to combat this is to market this towards people who wrtite for fun and are looking for positve feedback. That or allow other forms of
		story telling, such as visual art or with audio only. We can fix the black hat problems by accounting for them and finding unique ways to present 
		this project so it isn't like other apps for public writing.</p>
	<h2>Blue Hat</h2>
	<p>The subject of the project are storytellers in multiple mediums. We are thinking about ways to create a safe space for them to share their
		work in order to receive feedback or present to other people who also enjoy storytelling. The goal is to create a unique safe space for
		people who love to tell stories, whether it be in written, visual, or audio forms. We can keep the discussion on track by discussing ways people
		prefer to share information and projects. It could also help to go over features that haven't been used before or have not been executed well. 
		The conclusions we can draw from each hat are that, we need to understand how this will work. This idea has me excited for what can be done.
		There are flaws that need to be fixed. If resolved it can attract a lot of positive attention. We can fix these problems by finding unique ways 
		to present this, and the goal is to make it welcoming.
