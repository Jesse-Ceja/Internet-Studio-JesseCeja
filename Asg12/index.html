      <p>The twelve selected movies are ones that I like for various reasons. Some of them are movies based off of other media I like such as 
        videogames, anime, or tv series. Others are either stand alone films or later instalments in a movie franchise. The one thing that all of
        these movies have in common is they all have an engaging story. I love stories, and each of them have an overarching plot that has inspired me in some way.
