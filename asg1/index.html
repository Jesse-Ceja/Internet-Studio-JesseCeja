		<h2>Semester Project</h2>
		<p>While I am still not completely sure of the details regarding what I would like to accomplish for the semester project, I do at least have an idea.According to the information from the page on elearning, we are to avoid creating a website for portfolios. Not that I would have done that anyway. My basic concept for the website idea is to keep track of something, like the provided example “Basecamp.” I know it said unique ideas, but as of right now, I am still thinking of things that haven’t been done already. I’m sure it’ll strike me soon though.</p>
