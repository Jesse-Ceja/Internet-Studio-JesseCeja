	<h1>Design Statement</h1>
    <p>The aspeects used within each of the websites pages, were to capture the Hawaiian essence to give it a tropical vibe. 
        Though that description is very vauge so to be more specific I chose a background with a green color scheme to showcase the 
        green plant life that sprouts the islands. The overall color schemes of the other features such as the buttons have been chosen to 
        match the green background. The pages will have a monochromatic color scheme with the buttons being a different shade from the displayed 
        Hawaiian patterned background, but will still have a pallete that matches the overall theme. Even when you put the mouse over the buttons
        the shade it transforms into is part of the same color pallete.</p>
        <div>
<p>The typography chosen for the pages were not very easy to find, but I do belive that they will match with the aesthetic of the chosen location 
    and colors. The font family that was chosen to display as the headers was one called, Akronim. It was chosen due to the brushstroke look, it has.
    I thought that this apeal fit the Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders aesthetic, and gave it more of a ancient tribal feel. Then there was the font family 
    chosen for the paragraphs. This one is known as Lemonada. I chose these for the paragrphs design because of how it looks a bit like a more 
    modernized version of Akronim. It is also easier to read, but has enough style to stand out as a font type.
