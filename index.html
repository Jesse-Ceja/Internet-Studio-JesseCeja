	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>I enjoy videogames, anime, music and literally anything else an art major would enjoy. Though those things are just surface level. I am a Christian who belives in God.
	My goal is to become the man that God made me to be, instead of living for the world, I want to live for God. I believe that my asporations to become an artist can be used 
	to spread the word of God, so I need to become better with my artistic abilites, and a better person in general.</p>
