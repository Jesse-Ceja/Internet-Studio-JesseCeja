    <h2>Why They're My Favorite</h2>
	<p>The Vanished People are my favorite band because of their genre of music. I've always loved j-pop and j-rock music. 
		Knowing that their style utilizes from multiple genres like these to create new songs is incredible and I have loved every song they have relased. 
		I also have a special connection to this band because my friend I have known since I was 14 introduced them to me when they first came out.
		 Ever since I moved from that friend I have felt that this band is a remninder of how they have been a constant good in my life, even now.</p>
